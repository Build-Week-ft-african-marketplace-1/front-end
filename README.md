# African-Marketplace-01
☝️ Pitch
Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty.

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listings for items they have for sale.

✅ MVP
A small business owner can log in and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

They can also make listing for items they want to sell, which will show up to all users.

They add a new item by selecting their market location and typing in their item's name, description, and price.
